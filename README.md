# Birb Hunt
Somebody once told us the world was gonna roll us, cause we ain't the sharpest
tools in the shed. To prove them wrong we enrolled in the
[Computer Graphics](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?c_classe=744826)
course at Politecnico di Milano, where we developed this little browser game as a project.

The game is developed on top of WebGL 2.0 with no additional frameworks.
